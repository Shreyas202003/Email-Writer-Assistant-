cd email-writer-assistant

Configure Environment:
Open backend/src/main/resources/application.properties.

mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
The backend will start at http://localhost:8080.
Chrome Extension Setup
Navigate to Extension Folder:
cd extension
Load in Chrome:
Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.
Enable "Developer mode" (top right).
Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder.
Verify Icons:
Ensure the icons/ folder contains icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png.
Usage
Start the Backend:
Ensure the Spring Boot app is running (http://localhost:8080).
Open Gmail:
Go to mail.google.com in Chrome.
Open a new compose window (click "Compose").
Generate a Reply:
Type or paste email content into the compose window.
Click the "Generate Reply" button (appears at the bottom of the compose area).
The AI-generated reply will replace the content in the text box, styled according to the default tone ("professional").
Customize Tone (Optional)**:
Modify the content.js file to change the tone parameter in the fetch request (e.g., "friendly", "casual").
Example API Request
The extension sends a POST request to the backend:

{
    "emailContent": "Hi, can you help me with this?",
    "tone": "professional"
}
